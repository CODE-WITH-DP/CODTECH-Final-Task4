# Overview of the Project

### Project: BUILD A CHROME EXTENSION FOR PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT
- The Real-Time Chat Application is a modern communication platform that allows users to exchange messages instantly.
Built using the MERN stack, this application demonstrates real-time data synchronization between multiple clients,
providing an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly interface for chatting. The project implements features like user authentication,
live message updates, and typing indicators, ensuring a seamless user experience with Socket.IO.
