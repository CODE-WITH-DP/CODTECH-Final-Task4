# Overview of the Project

### Project: REAL-TIME CHAT APPLICATION
- The Real-Time Chat Application is a modern communication platform that allows users to exchange messages instantly.
Built using the MERN stack, this application demonstrates real-time data synchronization between multiple clients,
providing an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly interface for chatting. The project implements features like user authentication,
live message updates, and typing indicators, ensuring a seamless user experience with Socket.IO.


### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a fully functional real-time messaging platform that leverages the power of modern web technologies. The objectives include:

- Demonstrating real-time communication using WebSockets.
- Building a scalable and maintainable backend with Node.js and Express.
- Creating an intuitive and responsive frontend with React.js.
- Managing and storing user and chat data efficiently using MongoDB.
- Implementing secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
